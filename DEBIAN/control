Description: Elegant and simple dock with per-monitor window tracking.
 Plank Reloaded Plus is a fork of Plank Reloaded, which itself is a fork of
 the original Plank project. It provides a simple dock for X11 desktop
 environments, actively supporting Cinnamon, MATE, Xfce, and KDE.
 .
 Building on Plank Reloaded's foundation, Plank Reloaded Plus introduces
 enhanced multi-monitor awareness. Each dock instance tracks which monitor it
 is running on and filters window indicators accordingly: pinned app indicators
 only count windows present on the same monitor as the dock, and unpinned apps
 are hidden from a dock instance when none of their windows are on that
 monitor. This applies both when running one dock per monitor and when using
 the single-instance "follow active monitor" mode.
 .
 Like its predecessors, Plank Reloaded Plus aims to be a mildy simple dock on
 the planet, providing just what a dock needs (in my opinion) and almost nothing more.
